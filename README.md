    This here is an employee tracker. This application allows you to view, edit, and remove employees within your company - all laid out in organized tables. You can also view departments and roles.

    This is the first application I made that utilizes mySQL combined with the express and inquirer packages. You will notice the main display upon launching the app - this was made using the figlet package.

    Challenges
</h2>

<p>
    There were plenty of challenges for me when it came to this application. First of all, getting comfortable with mySQL was a challenge within itself. Although the app does not currently use any JOINs, I was able to practice and feel good about using them.

    Also, setting up the updateEmployee() function was challenging. It is still a work in progress, but I will have this part running soon.
